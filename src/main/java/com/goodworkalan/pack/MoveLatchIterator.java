/**
 * An iterator over a linked list of move latches that guard pages.
 * <p>
 * The move list is extended by appending a list of move latch nodes, so that
 * the move latch nodes in the move list itself are chains of related moves.
 * This means that we can {@link #skip()} a particular sub linked list of moves,
 * so that a thread can skip the latches that it adds itself.
 * <h2>Position</h2>
 * The list of user page moves is passed to the {@link GuardedVoid} and
 * {@link Guarded} so that {@link Mutator#free(long)} and
 * {@link Mutator#write(long, java.nio.ByteBuffer)} can determine if they are
 * freeing or writing to a page that has been moved. This is a special case.
 * <p>
 * Pages allocated by a <code>Mutator</code> are tracked using a {@link Movable}
 * at the outset. The <code>Movable</code> will adjust the position it
 * references according to the latch node linked list that starts from the node
 * that was the tail when the position was allocated.
 * <p>
 * Pages that are referenced by the client programmer that were not created by
 * the <code>Mutator</code>
