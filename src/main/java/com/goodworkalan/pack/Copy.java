/**
 * Copy does not wait on mirrored pages, since it is called only on 
 * pages that it has vacuumed and mirrored. In the cases of address
 * expansion, copy will be draining a mirrored page using free. Any
 * writers or readers will block and when the block is not found, they
 * will dereference the address page again, to determine the new location
 * of the block.
 * <p>
 * This use means the mirror flag should block for address page relocation
 * through the entire commit, whereas with an ordinary commit, we can
 * allow concurrent writes after the vacuum commit.
