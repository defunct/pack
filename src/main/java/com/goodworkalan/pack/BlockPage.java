/**
 * <p>
 * A relocatable page that contains a list of data blocks.
 * <h3>Duplicate Soft References</h3>
 * <p>
 * The data page is the only page that can take advantage of the duplication
 * soft references in the raw page class. The raw page holds a soft reference to
 * the byte buffer. It is itself soft referenced by the map of pages by position
 * in the pager.
 * <p>
 * All pages write their changes out to the byte buffer. We hold onto dirty raw
 * pages in a dirty page map. Once the raw page is written to disk we let go of
 * the hard reference to the raw page in the raw page map. It can be collected.
 * <p>
 * The data page also contains a lock that keeps another mutator from writing to
 * it when it is being vacuumed. The lock is based on the <code>wait</code> and
 * <code>notify</code> methods of the data page object. The byte buffer may be
 * flushed to disk, but a data page waiting to be vacuumed still needs to be
 * held in memory because of the lock.
 * <h4>Two-Stage Vacuum</h4>
 * <p>
 * Vacuum must work in two stages. The page is mirrored. The blocks that are
 * preceded by one or more freed blocks are copied into interim pages. Then
 * during journal play back, the compacting is performed by copying the mirrored
 * blocks into place over the freed blocks.
 * <p>
 * Once a page is mirrored, no other mutator can write to that page, since that
 * would put it out of sync with the mirroring of the page. If we were to mirror
 * a page and then another mutator updated a block in the page, if the blocks is
 * preceded by one or more freed blocks, then that block would be reverted when
 * we compact the page from the mirror.
 * <p>
 * Initially, you thought that a strategy was have the writing mutator also
 * update the mirror. This caused a lot of confusion, since now the journal was
 * changing after the switch to play back. How does one mutator write to another
 * mutator's journal? Which mutator commits that change? This raised so many
 * questions, I can't remember them all.
 * <p>
 * The mirrored property is checked before an mutator writes or frees a block.
 * If it is true, indicating that the page is mirrored but not compacted, then
 * the operation will block until the compacting makes the vacuum complete.
 * <p>
 * Vacuums occur before all other play back operations. During play back after a
 * hard shutdown, we run the vacuums before all other operations. We run the
 * vacuums of each journal, then we run the remainder of each journal.
 * <h4>Deadlock</h4>
 * <p>
 * Every once and a while, you forget and worry about deadlock. You're afraid
 * that one thread holding on a mirrored data page will attempt to write to a
 * mirrored data page of anther thread while that thread is trying to write a
 * mirrored data page held the this thread. This cannot happen, of course,
 * because vacuums happen before write or free operations.
 * <p>
 * You cannot deadlock by mirroring, because only one mutator at a time will
 * ever vacuum a data page, because only one mutator at a time can use a data
 * page for block allocation.
