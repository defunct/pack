/**
 * Manages a pool of references to the addresses of temporary blocks. A
 * temporary block is a block that is used to store data in an intermediate step
 * during storage. A set of temporary blocks is made available to the client
 * programmer via the {@link Opener} when a file is reopened.
 * <p>
 * Why not use {@link LookupPagePool} to create a list of addresses in use?
 * Because the reserve a reference pattern is easy to journal. The lookup page
 * pool goes to great lengths to reduce its size, maintaining a linked list of
 * lookup blocks, sorting each of the blocks by the page position value, so that
 * the lookup page pool does a lot of writing, and the sorted blocks means
 * over-writing. These operations would require copying to journal correctly.
 * <p>
 * The temporary page pool reuses the {@link AddressPage} journal strategy of
 * reserving a page position, then setting it to the referenced value during
 * commit.
