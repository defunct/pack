/**
 * Used during commit to lock freed addresses to prevent their possible
 * reallocation from being written before the free operation commit completes.
 * <p>
 * This class is specific to the relatively simple task of preventing the
 * overwrite of a reallocation by replaying a journaled free. It is not intended
 * to be the basis of a general purpose synchronization algorithm. Specifically,
 * it is not intended to lock addresses for users, to coordinate user writes or
 * frees.
 * <p>
 * During free, the address in the address page is set to zero, indicating that
 * the address is available for reallocation. Without some form of
 * synchronization it is possible for another mutator to reallocate the freed
 * address, then commit the reallocation, before the commit that freed the
 * address completes. If the commit that freed the address were not to complete
 * due to a system failure, then when the journals were replayed during recovery
 * the reallocation would be overwritten by the replay of the free.
 * <p>
 * This implementation multiplexes the addresses in 37 different sets of long
 * values and a set is chosen by hashing. Synchronization is performed on the
 * set, so contention is reduced by the reduced chance of two addresses hashing
 * to the same set at the same time.
 * <p>
 * TODO This doesn't work! If you lock the address, mark it as free, then sleep,
 * then the other thread marks it as pending, it sleeps, then you end up
 * flushing the pending to disk. The other thread rolls back. Then soft
 * shutdown. Now you've leaked an address.
