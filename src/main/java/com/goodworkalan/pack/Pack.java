     * What about quitting by writing an instruction, to a next pointer that

     * that the journals lie around until vacuumed, which is what we're doing
     * now anyway. Use an AddressPage to keep track of them.
     * <p>
     * Then use an address page for temporaries, be done with it.

     * survey, reap, super-vacuum if you want all your pages back.
