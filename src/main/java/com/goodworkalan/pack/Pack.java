/**
 * Management of a file as a reusable randomly accessible blocks of data.
 * <p>
 * Although this file structure is concurrent, isolated, and durable, it is not
 * atomic. A commit will update addresses so that isolated blocks become the
 * common blocks, however other mutators will see this change the moment it
 * happens. If two blocks allocated by a mutator, as the mutator commits, one
 * block will become visible to the user before the other block becomes visible.
 * <p>
 * Pack also supports exposing raw pages that are managed by the user. Raw pages
 * allocated via the file structure are dereferenced by an address, so they can
 * move to accommodate new address pages. The file structure reserves the first
 * bit of the page for housekeeping information. First bit, that is, not byte,
 * so you can use the first byte to store primitive Java types so long as the
 * value is not negative.
